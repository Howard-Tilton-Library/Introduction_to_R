# Intro to R, Part I: The Fundamentals

![](Data_In/Figures/TUL_Logos_narrow.png)

Greetings! This tutorial from Tulane University's Howard-Tilton Memorial Library is Part I of a two-part series. It is targeted towards faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduates new to R. Its goal is to provide the necessary foundation for processing and analyzing your own data that you will need for most, if not all projects, you work on. Additional information on project management, packages, "tidy" data, more complex processing and data visualizations will be provided in Part II.
