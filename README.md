# Intro_to_R

![](Data_In/Figures/TUL_Logos_narrow.png)

Greetings! This tutorial was originally commissioned by Tulane University's Howard-Tilton Memorial Library. It is targeted towards faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduates new to R. Its goal is to provide the necessary foundation for processing and analyzing your own data. Additional information on project management, packages, "tidy R," and data visualizations will be provided in Part II.
