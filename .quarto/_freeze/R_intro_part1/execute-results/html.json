This tutorial was originally commissioned by Tulane University's Howard-Tilton Memorial Library. It is targeted towards faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduates new to R. Its goal is to provide the necessary foundation for processing and analyzing your own data. Please see the Table of Contents on the left side of this window for an overview. Additional information on project management, packages, \"tidy R,\" and data visualizations will be provided in Part II.\n\nHappy coding!\n\n# **Download R & RStudio**\n\n### Fortunately, getting R and RStudio set up on your machine isn't too complicated. Just follow these steps:\n\n1.  [Download R from The Comprehensive R Archive & Network (CRAN).](https://cran.rstudio.com/) <br>\n\n![Downloading R for Windows. Mac users: Follow the \"Download R for macOS\" CRAN link and choose the R version appropriate for your OS and CPU.](./Data_In/Figures/download_R.png)\n\n2.  Install R. Default settings will work for most people. You should not need any shortcuts since RStudio will access R for us.\n\n3.  [Download RStudio from Posit.](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (You may need to scroll down the page a bit for downloads for Mac, older versions of Windows, and 32-bit systems).\n\n4.  Install RStudio. Default settings should be fine, but now you'll want to make sure you have an easily accessible shortcut!\n\n# **Navigating RStudio**\n\n### RStudio is divided into 4 movable panes:\n\n<br> <font size=\"5\"> 1. Console </font><br> This is where we run our R code/commands\n\n<font size=\"5\"> 2. Source </font><br> This is where we write, run, save, and edit **scripts**, which are text files containing our R code and can consist of many commands built off of each other.\n\n::: callout-note\n## <font size=\"5\"> Note </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> You may not see this pane if it's your first time starting up R Studio because you likely won't have an open script\\...more on this soon. </font>\n:::\n\n<font size=\"5\"> 3. Environment, History, Connections, Tutorial </font><br> We use this pane mostly for the Environment, which is where our data, functions, and other objects will be stored and accessed.\n\n<font size=\"5\"> 4. Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer, Presentation </font><br> I tend to keep this pane minimized until I need it. It can be very handy when you want to access a project file, create a figure, or reference a function's help section.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> You can change pane sizes by clicking and dragging pane edges or by using the buttons in the figure below: </font>\n:::\n\n![Expanding and minimizing panes](./Data_In/Figures/change_pane_size.png)\n\n### Personalizing Your RStudio\n\nThe four panes can be relocated to whichever screen quadrants you'd like: <br> `Tools -> Global Options -> Pane Layout`\n\nYou can adjust fonts, text sizes, color schemes, etc. under Global Options as well: <br> `Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance` <br>\n\n# **Console Calculator**\n\nYou can run basic and complex calculations, or even more complicated code, in the Console pane.\n\n::: callout-note\n## <font size=\"5\"> Note </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> The colorful lines below are R code! Entering each line of code in the Console yields R output. The `[1]` in the output shows the positional order of the leftmost result your code returned on that line. In this case, it's a single number on a single line. Many analyses will return multiple results listed one after the other across several lines, so these bracketed numbers can be useful for examining lengthier output. We'll see this later! </font>\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> Run some basic calculations by typing or copying them into the Console and hitting the \"Enter\" or \"Return\" key. </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 / 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.5\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3 * (5 - 3)^2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 12\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# **Your First R Script**\n\nThe R Console is great for one-off calculations, but what if you want to create, edit, and run code more than once? R scripts can solve this problem!\n\n-   Click on the \"New File\" button (a white square with green plus drop-down under File) and select \"R Script\n-   Now click `File -> Save As...`, give your file a meaningful name like \"R_intro_part1\", and save it somewhere you can find it again.\n\n![Click here to start a new R script!](./Data_In/Figures/new_script.png){width=\"400\"}\n\nFrom here on out, we'll be entering our code into our new R scripts. All of this could alternatively be run in the Console, but to revisit and edit code entered into the Console, you'd have to double click on past code under the History tab in the Environment panel, cycle through the history using `Ctrl/Cmd + [up arrow]` in the Console, or scroll up and copy/paste code back into the Console.\n\n## Running code in R scripts\n\nThere are a few ways to run code contained in a script:\n\n-   Run the current line your cursor is on (it doesn't need to be at the end).\n\n    -   Click the `Run` button at the top right corner of your Source pane (above your script)\n\n    -   Hit `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`\n\n-   Run the entire script\n\n    -   Highlight everything and click `Run`\n\n    -   `Ctrl/Cmd + A + Enter`\n\n-   Re-run the previous line\n\n    -   Click the button immediately to the right of `Run`, which shows a blue arrow turning back and a green arrow pointing forward.\n\n    -   `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt/Opt + P`\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> Run some basic calculations entered into your script. </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n2 * 3 * 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 24\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 / 7\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.1428571\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The Almighty `#`Hashtag\n\nIn addition to editing and running our R code, scripts are also great places to organize and **comment** on our code. The R language has reserved the `#` symbol for commenting and organization purposes. Here are some best practices to keep your scripts organized and understandable (always good when returning to your work after time away or sharing with collaborators!).\n\n-   Create collapsible sections using `# Section Title ----`\n\n-   Annotate your code with comments explaining what the code does and why. Each comment should start at the beginning of a line and should be preceded by a `#` and a single `Space`.\n\n-   Mute, or **comment out**, code you *don't* want to run by putting a `#` in front of it.\n\n    -   To comment out multiple lines, highlight them and hit `Ctrl/Cmd + Shft + C`\n\n::: callout-note\n## <font size=\"5\"> Note </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> All of these practices are on display below. </font>\n:::\n\n# **Creating Objects**\n\n**Objects** in R are containers that store information. Using the `<-` operator (`Alt/Opt + Hyphen [-]`), you can save information as objects in your Environment pane. This is similar to saving a file in a folder on your computer, but you can delete, recreate, rename, and edit that object with the code written in your script.\n\nAssigning data to objects allows you to \"call\", or access, the data whenever you want.\n\n## Single-value Numeric Examples\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> 1. Enter the code below in your new script to save some objects, use them in operations, and see the results. <br> 2. Employ good organizational practices using `#`. </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Creating Objects ----\n\n# Objects can be single values. In the line below, we assign a value to an object with a descriptive name.\nten <- 10\n\n# In this line, we \"call\" the object, which will produce its value in the Console output when run.\nten\n\n# Objects can also contain the results of calculations or functions.\ntwenty <- 4 * 5\ntwenty\n\n# And we can combine objects into more complex calculations.\nten + twenty\n\n# NOTE: object names cannot include spaces. Instead, use underscores to separate words.\nten_twenty <- ten + twenty\nten_twenty + 10\n\n# This code is \"commented out\" and won't run:\n# ten * 2 - twenty\n```\n:::\n\n\nOur only output should be the following for our two objects and the two sums we calculated using those objects:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```\n## [1] 10\n## [1] 20\n## [1] 30\n## [1] 40\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Overwriting Objects\n\nWhen working in most word processing programs, if you try to save a document with the same name as another file, the program will give you a warning. R does [NOT]{.underline} do that, so you need to be organized and intentional with how you name and re-name your objects.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> Experiment with reassigning objects. </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Here \"math\" = 15\nmath <- 3*5\nmath\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 15\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# But as soon as we run this code, every time we call \"math\" from now on, we'll get 25 instead.\nmath <- ten + math\nmath\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 25\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmath - ten_twenty\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Careful!\n\nR is case-sensitive and sensitive to typos, too! In fact, typos are the most common source of errors in R.

The objects we saved above were all what you might call \"integer\" or \"numeric\" classes. Another common data format is the **character** class, or text-based data. In R, **strings** are just character class text data in between quotation marks!\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> Make and manipulate some string objects. </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Put text in quotations to create a string.\ntu <- \"Tulane University\"\nloc <- \"New Orleans, LA\"\n\ntu\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Tulane University\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nloc\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"New Orleans, LA\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## <font size=\"5\"> Note </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> As you might expect, character and numeric classes are incompatible! And strings can't be used mathematically. What happens if you try to run the code below in your script? </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# You can't do math with text\ntu + 10\n\n# Nor can you combine string objects in ways you might think, but we'll learn how soon.\ntu + loc\ntu loc\ntu, loc\n```\n:::\n\n\n# **Vectors, Functions, Help, Cleaning**\n\n## Vectors\n\n**Vectors** are common objects in R. They're just lists of variables and can contain numbers, expressions, character strings, and more. You can think of these as analogous to a single column of data in Excel.\n\nTo create vectors, we have to use a **function**, which is just a pre-packaged code used to accomplish a specific task. Functions in R are written in the format `function.name(data = ..., arguments = ...)`, where additional `arguments` feed extra instructions to the function on how to manipulate the input `data`.\n\nThe function for creating a vector is `c()`. `c` stands for \"Combine Values into a Vector or List,\" but who wants to write all that out every time?\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> Create some vectors of your own. </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Vectors ----\n\n# Vectors combine values separated by commas.

This means there's a pre-packaged function out there for almost all of your needs.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> Test out some common functions below. What do they do? </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Function Practice ----\n\n# Here are a few functions that can take additional arguments, but we haven't supplied any.

R has a function called `rm()` (short for \"remove\") that you can use to do targeted house cleaning.\n\n-   You can always rerun your script to get your objects back after removing them!\n-   If you want to erase all objects, you can click the broom button in the Environment panel.\n    -   There are similar \"clearing\" broom buttons in the Console pane and under the History and Plots tabs.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> Let's get rid of extra objects we don't need anymore. </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(a, birds, loc, math, ten, ten_to_sixty, ten_twenty, tu, twenty, x, y, z)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# **Data Frames**\n\nIf vectors are equivalent to columns in an Excel or .csv file, then **data frames** are equivalent to the file or sheet itself! They're just one or more rows and one or more columns of data. In R, we commonly create, import, and combine data frames. Let's combine all three approaches to build a dataframe about those birds from earlier.\n\n## Creating\n\nLike most tabular information, data frames are organized by column. In R, they're created by column too within `data.frame()`. All we have to do is set a user-defined column name equal to a value, vector, or object.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> 1. Start a new collapsible section heading. <br> 2. Next, build your own data frame by defining your columns. <br> 3.

When code for a single function starts to get too long, it can be hard to visually digest. \n# In these instances, hit the \"Enter/Return\" key after each argument in a function, i.e., after the commas. \n# RStudio will automatically indent each new line for us so that they fall below their function's opening parenthesis.\nbird_data <- data.frame(species = rep(am_birds, each = 12),\n                        family = rep(c(\"Falconidae\", \"Corvidae\", \"Turdidae\"),\n                                     each = 12))\n```\n:::\n\n\nCongratulations! In addition to making your first data frame, you just combined [*three*]{.underline} functions for the first time by nesting `c()` inside `rep()` inside `data.frame()`! Take some time to inspect each component of this code to make sure you're clear on what the three functions did. You may find it helpful to start with the innermost piece (`c()`) and work your way out.\n\n::: callout-note\n## <font size=\"5\"> Note </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> When nesting functions, your parentheses really start to pile up. You can put your cursor after a closing parenthesis to highlight its opening parenthesis. One nice perk of RStudio is that it will warn you if you have too many or too few! </font>\n:::\n\n## Viewing\n\nLet's check out our results. There are a few ways to view your them:\n\n1.  Type the name of your data frame into the Console and hit Enter.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # NOTE: This gets quite cumbersome for large data sets, especially ones with lots of columns since the Console can't scroll left and right.\n    bird_data\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    ```\n                species     family\n    1  American Kestrel Falconidae\n    2  American Kestrel Falconidae\n    3  American Kestrel Falconidae\n    4  American Kestrel Falconidae\n    5  American Kestrel Falconidae\n    6  American Kestrel Falconidae\n    7  American Kestrel Falconidae\n    8  American Kestrel Falconidae\n    9  American Kestrel Falconidae\n    10 American Kestrel Falconidae\n    11 American Kestrel Falconidae\n    12 American Kestrel Falconidae\n    13    American Crow   Corvidae\n    14    American Crow   Corvidae\n    15    American Crow   Corvidae\n    16    American Crow   Corvidae\n    17    American Crow   Corvidae\n    18    American Crow   Corvidae\n    19    American Crow   Corvidae\n    20    American Crow   Corvidae\n    21    American Crow   Corvidae\n    22    American Crow   Corvidae\n    23    American Crow   Corvidae\n    24    American Crow   Corvidae\n    25   American Robin   Turdidae\n    26   American Robin   Turdidae\n    27   American Robin   Turdidae\n    28   American Robin   Turdidae\n    29   American Robin   Turdidae\n    30   American Robin   Turdidae\n    31   American Robin   Turdidae\n    32   American Robin   Turdidae\n    33   American Robin   Turdidae\n    34   American Robin   Turdidae\n    35   American Robin   Turdidae\n    36   American Robin   Turdidae\n    ```\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n2.  Use the `View()` function. [*WARNING*]{style=\"color: red;\"}: this function *must* be capitalized! BUT, it's a lot more manageable than trying to inspect big data directly in the Console. Usually you don't want to put `View()` in your script, however, so type or copy it into your Console instead. You should have the same results open up in a new tab beside your script in the Source panel.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    View(bird_data)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n    ![Viewing your data frame should open a new tab in your Source panel that looks like this.](./Data_In/Figures/view_df1.png){width=\"450\"}\n\n3.  Lastly, you can click on the name of your data frame in the Environment tab for the same effect. Note also that the Environment tab will show you how many rows (obs.) your data frame contains and how many columns (variables). We can also see that the `am_birds` object is a character class (chr) containing three values.\n\n    ![You can click here instead of using View().](./Data_In/Figures/view_df2.png){width=\"450\"}\n\n## Importing\n\nIf you're working through this tutorial, you probably have data of your own that you hope to analyze in R! Let's learn how to import data from other sources.\n\n::: callout-note\n## <font size=\"5\"> Note </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> It's good practice to use .csv files for data import and export. They're less bulky (which makes R run much faster and leaves more memory for analyses and object storage), there are fewer odd formatting issues, you don't have to deal with sheets, and they're more easily shared across platforms. </font>\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> 1. Import some bird measurement data to accompany this tutorial directly from the web. <br> 2.

Often, `[` references rows, columns, or individual cells in a data frame. Using similar ideas as the `$` above, we can use `[` to target specific parts of our data for editing. Another common use of `[` is to extract data from if it meets specified criteria.\n\nThere are a few ways to use `[` at the basic level with data frames.

Check for `NAs` in all rows and columns with `complete.cases()`. <br> 4. Remove all `NAs` with `na.omit()`.</font>\n:::\n\n## 1. `na.rm = TRUE`\n\nTo illustrate the issues raised by missing values, let's try to run some summary statistics on one species in our data frame: the American Robin.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Missing data ----\n\n# First, we'll have to create an object containing just robins by subsetting the larger bird_data data frame\nrobins <- subset(bird_data, species == \"American Robin\")\n\n# Next, let's try running some functions we learned earlier.\nmean(robins$mass_g)\n## [1] NA\n\nmedian(robins$wing_length_mm)\n## [1] NA\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Uh oh. Those NAs gummed up the works. There's a quick and easy fix, though!\n# Add the na.rm (NA remove) argument.\nmean(robins$mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\n## [1] 80.3\n\nmedian(robins$wing_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)\n## [1] 133.9\n\n# NOTE: This approach saves more data than eliminating entire rows to deal with NAs!\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 2. `is.na()`\n\nWe can also identify rows with `NAs`, or the lack thereof, in *individual columns* using the `is.na()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This code provides all the rows where the specified column contains an NA\nsubset(bird_data, is.na(mass_g))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          species   family wing_length_mm mass_g mass_to_wing\n13  American Crow Corvidae          802.6     NA           NA\n26 American Robin Turdidae          110.1     NA           NA\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Conversely, this removes all rows with an NA in the specified column.\n# Just like != means \"is not equal to,\" !is.na() means \"is not NA.\"\n# Give it a whirl. You shouldn't see any rows with NAs.\nsubset(bird_data, !is.na(mass_g))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3. `complete.cases()`\n\nWhat if we want to check for `NAs`in *all* rows across *all* columns *at the same time*? There's actually a very powerful function which can be combined with `[` for exactly that purpose!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# complete.cases() checks each row to determine if there is an NA present in any column.\n# Every time a FALSE is returned, it's for a row with NAs.\ncomplete.cases(bird_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n[13] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n[25]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# We can combine that with [ to extract those rows.\nbird_data[!complete.cases(bird_data), ]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n            species     family wing_length_mm mass_g mass_to_wing\n5  American Kestrel Falconidae             NA  112.2           NA\n13    American Crow   Corvidae          802.6     NA           NA\n17    American Crow   Corvidae             NA  498.2           NA\n26   American Robin   Turdidae          110.1     NA           NA\n29   American Robin   Turdidae             NA   70.2           NA\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 4. `na.omit()`\n\nLet's pretend that, for some reason, we're not interested in any individuals with `NA` values anywhere. Perhaps we're only interested in the mass to wing ratio, so an `NA` in either of those columns makes that row useless to us. In that case, we can remove all rows with an NA in any column using the `na.omit()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# na.omit() removes all rows where an NA is present regardless of column.\n# Powerful, but it throws away a lot of data, e.g., you may want to include birds missing wing data in analyses on mass.\n# Let's create a new object without NAs.\nbird_data_clean <- na.omit(bird_data)\n\n# NOTE: using na.omit is essentially a less wordy version of \n# bird_data[complete.cases(bird_data), ]\n\n# We can (and should!) verify our code worked.\n# NOTE: The presence and absence of the ! is critical.\n# This should not return any results because all NAs should have been removed in the step above!\nbird_data_clean[!complete.cases(bird_data_clean), ]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] species        family         wing_length_mm mass_g         mass_to_wing  \n<0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# **Exporting Data**\n\nSuccess! You've made it to the end! Congratulations! 🎉🎉🎉\n\nOur last bit of code is a quick and easy one to take your processed data out of R and store it on your machine.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## <font size=\"5\"> Try it </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> Use `write.csv()` to export your data. </font>\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# write.csv() wants your data/object first, then a file name, and then you can feed it other arguments. Here we're specifying not to include row names since in this case they're just the number of each row. In some cases, you may choose to set your rownames to something more meaningful.\n# Remember, Windows users must replace the \\ in their pathways with / or \\\\ in order for R to recognize it.\nwrite.csv(bird_data_clean, file = \"C:/Users/Your Username/Desktop/bird_data_output.csv\",\n          row.names = FALSE)\n\n# For Mac Users\nwrite.csv(bird_data_clean, file = \"Users/Your Username/Desktop/bird_data_output.csv\",\n          row.names = FALSE)\n\n# NOTE: Every time you run this code, it will overwrite your saved file unless you edit the destination file name! For that reason, you may want to enter this command strictly in your console or else comment it out after running it in your script, e.g., \n\n# write.csv(bird_data_clean, file = \"C:/Users/Your Username/Desktop/bird_data_output.csv\", \n#           row.names = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## <font size=\"5\"> Note </font>\n\n<font size=\"4\"> We'll also streamline exporting in *Intro to R Part II*.
